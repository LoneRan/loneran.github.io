Work on both Mobile and PC platforms, specializing in developing cool features focusing on weapon systems, and performance optimization. Stay at the forefront of the game industry.

Gameplay:

• Engineered and executed multiple replication strategies to maximize performance, resulting in a 40% increase in
gameplay smoothness and reduced network bandwidth usage.
• Led the development of tactical equipment and melee weapons, including new weapon design, mechanism realization, visual and audio effects, animation, UI design, camera control and damage validation, resulting in positive player feedback and increased engagement.
• Optimized character movement performance by configuring movement combination, resulting in a 10% improvement in dedicated server’s cpu performance.
• Implemented pre-performance of character’s first person experience, ensuring seamless functionality and accuracy even in low network conditions.
• Deployed new features using Gameplay Ability System and Gameplay Effect, enhancing gameplay depth
• Created an algorithm to simulate real physical gas diffusion, implemented on tactical equipment, resulting in a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience, recognized with a patent.

Server

• Implemented Dynamic Tick Rate of Dedicated Server based on multiple strategies, dynamically adjusting tick rates in real-time to provide low-latency experience for users and reduce server costs (patent issued).
• Maintained dedicated servers and proactively resolved crashes to ensure uninterrupted gameplay for 9 million daily active users, achieving a 99.9% server uptime and minimizing player disruption.
• Developed an automatic network flow monitor using Network Insights data, detecting large bunches and overseeing network flow changes between versions, resulting in a 30% reduction in network-related issues and improved overall game stability.
• Design a pattern arranged by dedicated server agent, manage dedicated server to be forked from parent process, create actor pool for later use, implement TCP network communication between seed Dedicated Servers and backend server
• Developed a preload object pool to spawn actors when needed for different maps and game modes, reducing real-time costs by 80% and game startup time by 10%.
